Another year has come and gone, and I've decided to redesign and reimplement certain features of this site. Lets start with a post-mortem of sorts since the last time I wrote something here.

## 2021

Stuck in the midst of the pandemic and absent from the tech industry proper due to being burned out, I was finally determined to get back to doing what I love to do &mdash; create awesome software.

I had been following [@kvlly](https://twitter.com/kvlly) on Twitter for a while, and she was teasing a new company called Govalo. She had posted a link to the website, and while she and her cofounder [@rhiankatie](https://twitter.com/rhiankatie) were still in stealth about the company, I was intrigued.

The interview was set, Monday October 11th, at noon. I was nervous, but I was also excited. This wouldn't be my first interview since my last job, but I was prepared. Leading up to this, I completely bombed an interview with one startup and had an intro call with a founder who negged me about my _kitschy_ website then lowballed me on salary.

I had also recently done some client work for some friends as well as built a Twilio-powered SMS forwarder for when I was working solo as a stage manager for a small improv theater. I was ready to talk about my experience, and I was ready to talk about what I wanted to do.

The day of the interview arrives, I sit down on Zoom with Kelly and Rhian and we have a wonderful discussion. We talk about my experience and my goals, and I learn how Govalo is planning on disrupting gifting in the ecommerce space.

A sigh of relief. Finally.

## Working at Govalo

I started at Govalo on November 2nd. The team was small, but very diverse. After I started, two more product engineers, 3 implementation engineers, and a solutions engineer joined the team. We were all remote, and we were all working hard to build a product that would change the way people give gifts.

It's _really fun_ to join a startup early. You get to see the product grow from a few features to a full-fledged product. You get to see the team grow from a few people to a full team. You get to see the company grow from a few customers to a full customer base. You get to influence the culture, the product, and engineering practices along the way.

### Race to the First Pull Request

As an aside, I alway challenge myself at every new job.

1. How quickly can I get my environment set up?
2. How quickly can I get my first PR opened?
3. How quickly can I get that first PR released?

Luckily, with the existing documentation and support from a teamate (shoutout to you [@joshecheverri](https://twitter.com/joshecheverri)), I was able to get my environment set up really quickly, probably within an hour.

While my first PR wasn't a full feature, it was a tiny change to some copy in the app, it was submitted 1 hour and 19 minutes after I started on my first day, merged that very same day. We did manual releases, so it wasn't released until a few days later, but this was a personal record.

## Personal Growth

Since beginning my career back in 2010 with Quest Software (later acquired by Dell), I've mostly focused on being really good at the front end of applications. Yes, those roles where my title was "Full stack" too. Even when I was studying compilers in college, I went as far as building a user interface for my final project with QT.

I didn't have the luxury, if you could call it that, of focusing solely on the UI at Govalo. Nor did I really want to. I would always preface conversations about backend development with interviewers with "I know enough to get into trouble".

{/* Here, talk about getting more comfortable with mentoring, building full stack features, and projects you worked on. */}
