The new year has come; a time for new beginnings.

Kevin McCarthy (at time of writing) has failed 6 votes to become speaker of the house, which would be funny if it didn't illustrate how bad the GOP is at actually governing&mldr;

In GoodNews&copy; – I am excited to announce my next role!

As of this Monday, I will be a Senior Software Engineer at [Heyday](https://heyday.xyz).

Technically, I started yesterday (Jan 3rd), but because of vacation schedules
and the like we decided to push the start date.

## Heyday

Heyday is an AI powered memory and learning assistant tailored towards knowledge workers. You can learn more about the company at [Heyday.xyz](https://heyday.xyz)

### Inevitability?

You can see that the branding for Heyday includes these glyphs of hands in various positions; waving, pointing, giving a thumbs up. Coincidentally, I've been using the <span role="image" aria-label="waving hand">👋</span> emoji as my favicon on my website for a couple years, so... I think it was meant to be.

## Atom Feed and Bring Back Blogging

Inspired by [Bring Back Blogging](https://bringback.blog/), I've opted to implement an atom feed here for my blog.

import { FontAwesomeIcon } from "@fortawesome/react-fontawesome";
import { faSquareRss } from "@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons";

[Here is the link to my feed <FontAwesomeIcon
  icon={faSquareRss}
  className="transition-colors text-zinc-500 dark:text-zinc-300 group-hover:text-sky-600 "
  size="lg"
/>.](https://nickradford.dev/api/feeds/atom.xml)

I built this using [jpmonette/feed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feed) and referencing this [great blog post by Daan Debie](https://www.daan.fyi/writings/rss).

To power this, I have an API route at `api/feeds/atom.xml` which will

1. Create a feed using the `feed` library
2. Iterate through my posts using `feed.addItem` to add the relevant content (including the static markup for the post)
3. Set a `Cache-Control` header to 1 day
4. Return the xml

## New Year, New Goals

A rough list of things I would like to happen in the next 365(ish) days

- Drink less alcohol
- Play and finish more games (I'm looking at you, Steam Library)
- Walk to places more than Uber
- Read more than I did last year (this is a very low bar, unfortunately)
- Finally, write more here on my blog
