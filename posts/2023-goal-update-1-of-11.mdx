In my [New Job, Atom Feed, 2023 Goals](/blog/new-job-and-atom-feed) post I mentioned 5 goals for the new year. This is the first of 11 posts I will make throughout the rest of this year with updates.

{/* excerpt */}

## 1. Drink less alcohol.

In 2022, it would be too easy for me to find a reason to put my shoes on, and head out to one of my neighborhood bars, drink all night, sometimes past close. I'd spend a bunch of money wiping out brain cells and the only regret I'd have the next day was the hangover. Yes, even on a week night.

I want to change that. And so far, I have. I can count on 1 hand the number of days I've had a drink, and on two hands the number of drinks total -- no toes!

Roughly, the numbers are 3 nights, one of which being a company holiday party, and the total number of drinks is 8.

So far so good!

## 2. Play and finish more games.

Probably due to depression that hasn't quite been eradicated due to #1 from last year, I would find myself starting a game, getting absorbed into its story and characters, the music, the art... everything, just to try to find that high I felt beating that first boss, mastering a small system, or falling for a character.

According to steam, my last 9 played games, in reverse play order with estimated last session time:

export const ListItem = ({ game, time, comment }) => (
  <li>
    <div className="flex flex-col text-base">
      <div className="space-x-2">
        <span className="font-bold">{game}</span>
        <span className="text-sm">{time}</span>
      </div>
      <p>{comment}</p>
    </div>
  </li>
);

import gameStuff from "./posts/game-stuff.js";

<ol reversed="reversed">
  {gameStuff.map(([game, time, comment]) => (
    <ListItem game={game} time={time} comment={comment} />
  ))}
</ol>

### **Cult of the** <del>motherfucking</del> **Lamb**

This game man. SO GOOD.

✅ Adorable art.

✅ Fun combat.

✅ Tarot cards.

✅ Ritualistic-animal-spousal-sacrifice.

Just play it. Devolver Digital (the publisher) can't miss, I tell ya.

In short, I'm playing games more frequently, but I still jump from game to game

## 3. Walk to places more than Uber.

Door to from my apartment to my office is about 35 minutes. I'll normally stop for coffee nearby, grab a cup to go, and walk until I find a bus heading my direction towards San Franciso's Fidi. That is, if I don't get lazy and just order an Uber/Lyft.

> Do a blurb about Apple Fitness comparing YoY?

## 4. Read more than I did last year.

> Maybe a progress bar after some short blurbs about

- The Ninth House
- The Invisible Library
- Elder Race

## 5. Write more here on my blog.

> 3rd post this year, 2nd in a week, writing is cathartic, keeps me accountable to the rest of my goals
