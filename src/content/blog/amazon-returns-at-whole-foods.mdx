Two weeks ago, I ordered a wireless CarPlay adapter so my partner and I wouldn't have to plug in our phones when driving in order to use CarPlay.

Unfortunately, thanks to Amazon's great UX, I didn't apply the coupon code that would have saved me like $30. On top of that, there's a newer version of the same product that starts at $20 cheaper than the one I bought...

With the trend of global conglomeration, it shouldn't have surprised me that I could select Whole Foods, an Amazon subsidiary, as a return location.

Luckily there's a Whole Foods about 2 blocks from me, and I hadn't had lunch yet; two birds with one stone I guess.

As an aside, I have a subscription to Midjourney, and I'm going to start adding generative art to my posts to spruce things up a bit.
